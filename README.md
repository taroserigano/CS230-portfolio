Portfolio for the SNHU CS230

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? 

# The Gaming Room is our client and currently has a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that was created for Android systems.

What type of software did they want you to design?

# The Gaming Room was interested in expanding their user base by ditributing the game in traditional computing platforms such as Windows, Mac and Linux. They were also interested in bringing this game to mobile platform in order to gain more users.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

# I guess my strength in this assignment was that I did my research pretty hard and well. Every week, each assignment was challenging me to learn something new and unheard of, so in this course, I definitely did some extensive research in order to attend to this document. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

# The design document has helped me to see the general scope of how the design is set up throughout. And then, of course I had to implement some additional code, so figuring out the whole design really helped me to see the relationship between the objects, variables and such and add some implementation. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

# This is my opinion but I found using the Iterator class was a little strange. 
You could totally do the same fine by using for loops and I didn't see any spiecific reaosn why to use Iterator class, I found the code got a bit messy by actually using it. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? 

# Definitely by having the Singleton class. This was to ensure that is no duplication of players and avoid confusion for them when playing this game. 


Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

# It is seriously important nowadays because simply the users have no patience nowadays. Also users are saturated with so many competitive games around,
they would simply leave the game if there's any inconvenience such as errors or poor game design. It is crucial nowadays to make sure the game can be played at ease and with solid comfort and error free. 


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

# I basically just followed whatever the requirements were by the modules each week. If I were to enhance the features in this game in the future, I'd definitely make it more interactive. Like, adding web cam features, adding audio so users can speak, adding some animations or SE when players make combo or something to make the game more appealing.
